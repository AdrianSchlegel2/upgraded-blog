# Upgraded Blog Templating Website
 A blog website that hosts itself over your own PC. It is an upgraded version of my Blog Templating Website from a few weeks ago: https://github.com/Schageus/Blog-Templating-Project. Read this to understand the basics of the website:
 
 *From the other Github post: A website that hosts itself over your own PC. The website is made to host blogs and the blogs can be either be held in a list like this: [{id:x, {body: x, title: x, subtitle:x}], or you can load the data in the same format from an API, as I have done it. The website itself is hosted using the webframework: Flask and a combination of HTML and CSS. To host the website yourself just download the source code, run it and click on the link you get. It should be something like http://156.0.0.3:7000*
 
 In this specific website I changed the overall look, by implementing the free open source Frontend-CSS-Framework by Twitter, Bootstrap. I used a bootstrap template from: https://startbootstrap.com/previews/clean-blog. 
 
 As mentioned before you can use your own blog posts by simply creating a dictionary with the previously mentioned keys.
